    <p class="page-description clearfix">
      EMK has initiated work on the doll collection that was previously housed in the Kennedy Family Home in Hyannisport. Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy began the doll collection as part of his position at the Court of St. James, with other dolls collected into the 40s, 50s, and possibly 60s. Each doll represents a country or ethnic group, and is dressed according to custom. Part of the Instituteâ€™s work included photographing some of the dolls for possible use in a digital exhibit.
